# Deploy to a live URL

The deck is one self-contained HTML file — theme CSS is inline and the engine/fonts load from a CDN — so there are **no local assets to bundle**. Publishing is just putting that single file online as `index.html`. No build, no `deploy.sh`, no asset copying.

Offer this after the deck is built (see SKILL.md Step 5). Let the user pick the host — don't assume one. All three options below are free static hosts and run through `npx`, so nothing is installed globally.

## Prepare (same for every host)

Put the deck at the root of an otherwise empty folder, named `index.html`, so the bare URL serves it:

```bash
mkdir -p .deploy && cp <deck-slug>.html .deploy/index.html
```

Deploy the `.deploy` folder, then remove it when done.

## The login reality

All three need a one-time account login, and that step is **interactive** — surge asks for email + password, Vercel/Netlify open a browser. You can't drive it from a tool call, and it can **not** go through the agent prompt's `!` shell either: `!` runs a command but can't feed an interactive multi-prompt stdin, so `npx surge login` just hangs at `email:` with nowhere to type.

So the login has to happen in the user's **own terminal window** (the real Terminal/iTerm app, not this session). Tell the user to run the login command there, complete it, and report back. The credential is saved to disk (`~/.netrc` for surge, the CLI's own config for Vercel/Netlify), and from then on the deploy command reads it — so once the user is logged in, **you** run the deploy non-interactively.

Alternative for a fully agent-driven deploy: a token. If the user pastes one, deploy with it and skip the terminal step entirely — surge takes `SURGE_LOGIN` + `SURGE_TOKEN` env vars, Vercel takes `--token`, Netlify takes `--auth`.

## Option A — Surge

```bash
npx surge .deploy <deck-slug>.surge.sh
```

- Auth is email + password (no browser). The user runs `npx surge login` once in their own terminal — it can't run through the prompt's `!` (see above). After that, the deploy below reads the saved credential.
- Pass an explicit `<something>.surge.sh` domain or it prompts for one. Pick a slug from the deck title; if it's taken, add a short suffix.
- Re-running with the same domain overwrites it — the URL stays put.

## Option B — Vercel

```bash
npx vercel deploy .deploy --yes --prod
```

- Check auth with `npx vercel whoami`. If not logged in, have the user run `npx vercel login` in their own terminal (opens a browser), then re-run the deploy.
- Prints a production `https://…vercel.app` URL. Re-deploying the same project updates the same URL.
- Take it down later from the Vercel dashboard.

## Option C — Netlify

```bash
npx netlify deploy --dir=.deploy --prod
```

- Check auth with `npx netlify status`. If not logged in, have the user run `npx netlify login` in their own terminal (opens a browser), then re-run.
- First deploy may ask to create/link a site — accept the create option. Prints a `https://…netlify.app` URL.

## After deploying

1. Open the live URL once to confirm it renders (right canvas, fonts loaded).
2. Give the user the URL and one line: it works on any device, share it anywhere.
3. Delete the temp folder: `rm -rf .deploy`. Vercel and Netlify also drop a link folder in the working directory — `.vercel` or `.netlify` — that ties it to the created site. It's not junk: keeping it lets a later redeploy reuse the same site/URL without re-linking. Remove it (`rm -rf .vercel .netlify`) only when this was a throwaway and the user won't redeploy. Surge leaves nothing behind.
4. Mention `?print-pdf` still works on the live URL for anyone who wants a PDF (`references/export-pdf.md`).
