 * Baseline security headers applied to every response.
 *
 * CSP ships as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` so the browser
 * surfaces violations in the console without blocking anything — once
 * we have confidence nothing legit trips it (two deploys, a pass on
 * every route), flip the key to `Content-Security-Policy` to enforce.
 *
 * The rest of the headers are straight blocks, safe to enforce today:
 *   - HSTS: only meaningful on HTTPS (no-op on http://localhost).
 *   - X-Content-Type-Options / Referrer-Policy:
 *     baseline OWASP hardening, no behavioural cost.
 *
 * X-Frame-Options is intentionally omitted. v0 and Vercel previews render
 * the application in an iframe, so DENY makes a healthy server appear as a
 * failed preview. Framing policy remains visible in the report-only CSP and
 * can be enforced at the deployment edge for a known production origin.
 *   - Permissions-Policy: we don't use camera / microphone / etc, so
 *     deny them. A supply-chain compromise or a forgotten plugin
 *     can't silently opt back in.

  /**
   * Cache-Control policy.
   *
   * Why this exists:
   *   Hostinger's CDN was applying `s-maxage=31536000` (1 year) to
   *   prerendered HTML pages by default. When a new deploy shipped
   *   fresh Turbopack chunk hashes, the edge kept serving year-old
   *   HTML referencing chunk filenames that no longer existed on
   *   disk — result: HTML 200, every /_next/static/*.js and .css
   *   came back 404, the page rendered unstyled. Private/incognito
   *   did nothing because the cache is server-side.
   *
   * Strategy:
   *   - /_next/static/* — leave to Next. Turbopack dev chunks can go
   *     stale if we force immutable caching here; Next already emits
   *     the correct production headers for hashed assets.
   *   - /api/*          — no-store. API responses are per-user and
   *     must never be shared across requests at the edge.
   *   - Everything else — public, brief s-maxage + generous
   *     stale-while-revalidate. The edge serves instantly from cache
   *     for the first 5 min, then returns cached content while
   *     refreshing in the background for up to 24 h. A deploy's
   *     chunk-hash drift self-heals within ~5 min with no user-
   *     visible latency.
   *
   *   Note: dynamic dashboard routes (/inbox, /contacts, /pipelines,
   *   /broadcasts, etc.) are server-rendered per request — Next.js
   *   and Supabase auth already prevent them from being served
   *   from a shared cache. The s-maxage here is a ceiling; Next.js
   *   and auth middleware still set `private` / `no-store` for
   *   per-user responses.
   *
   * Security headers are appended via a separate catch-all rule
   * below — Next.js merges headers from every matching rule, so
   * they apply to every response regardless of which cache rule
   * matched.
